# Install instructions

Generally speaking, copy everything to `~/`. There's an install.sh script
that isn't maintained but tried to be a bit more thorough. To install the
zsh theme, copy it to `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/`.

## Terminal Settings

Homebrew
Change text colors to silver (Crayons palette)
Close if the shell exited cleanly
Disable audible bell
